Lagos State is located in the southwestern part of Nigeria and is bordered by Ogun State to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south. The state consists of islands, coastal plains and lagoon systems including Lagos Lagoon, Ologe Lagoon and Lekki Lagoon. The city’s geography results in a tropical climate with rainy and dry seasons. Flooding is a common environmental challenge due to heavy rainfall, rising sea levels and rapid urban development.
