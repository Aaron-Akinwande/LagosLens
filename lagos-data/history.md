Lagos was originally settled by the Awori subgroup of the Yoruba people, who established small fishing and farming communities around its lagoon. The area later became a major settlement under the Benin Empire, which controlled trade and appointed chiefs in Lagos. By the fifteenth century, Portuguese explorers arrived and named the area “Lago de Curamo,” which eventually evolved into Lagos. The city became a major center for the Atlantic slave trade until its abolition in the nineteenth century. In 1861, Lagos was annexed by the British as a colony, becoming an important administrative and commercial center in West Africa. Lagos served as the capital of Nigeria from 1914 until 1991, and today it remains the economic hub of the country.
