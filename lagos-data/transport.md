Lagos has multiple transportation systems including road, rail and water transport. The Bus Rapid Transit system, managed by LAMATA, provides dedicated lanes and high-capacity buses that connect major corridors such as CMS to Mile 12 and Oshodi to Abule Egba. The Lagos Blue Line rail system connects Marina to Mile 2, offering an electric-powered rail service that reduces travel time. Ferry services managed through LAGFERRY provide water transport routes linking Ikorodu, Falomo, CMS and Badagry. Informal transport systems such as danfo buses, okadas and keke napep remain widely used throughout the state.
